- **WebSocket communication**: Real-time updates between all connected clients
- **Persistent data**: Data persists between server restarts

### Data Structure

#### Survey Object
```javascript
{
  id: "unique_id",
  title: "Survey Title",
  customerName: "Customer Name",
  customerAddress: "Full Address",
  customerPhone: "Phone Number",
  customerEmail: "Email Address",
  status: "pending|in-progress|completed|cancelled",
  notes: "Additional notes",
  createdDate: "ISO date string",
  lastUpdated: "ISO date string"
}
```

#### File Object
```javascript
{
  id: "unique_file_id",
  name: "filename.pdf",
  size: 1024,
  type: "application/pdf",
  uploadDate: "ISO date string",
  surveyId: "survey_id"
}
```

## Server Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000)

### Production Deployment
For production deployment, consider:
1. **Database**: Replace file storage with a proper database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
2. **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS for secure WebSocket connections
3. **Load Balancing**: Use a load balancer for multiple server instances
4. **Environment Variables**: Configure production environment variables

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome 60+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 55+
- ‚úÖ Safari 12+
- ‚úÖ Edge 79+

## Security Notes

- **WebSocket Security**: Ensure proper authentication for production use
- **File Uploads**: Currently stores file metadata only (not actual files)
- **Data Validation**: Implement proper input validation for production
- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production for secure connections

## Customization

### Connection Issues
- Check if server is running on correct port
- Ensure firewall allows connections
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors

### Real-time Updates Not Working
